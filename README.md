# Notes
Mind development versions of ncursesw and menuw libraries dependencies.

For OS X version, just compile with make osx (and ignore the clang warnings).

In some systems, instead of menu.h, ncurses/menu.h (e.g. SUSE) must be included.

It is highly advisable to use a monospaced font in order to display the game correctly.

Enjoy!
